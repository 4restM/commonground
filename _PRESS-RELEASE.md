//Sub-Heading

CommonGround is an idea-sharing platform that aims for better understanding between different social groups.

//Summary

We’ve all read user comments on various social media sites that are just plain terrible. Oftentimes, it can be a waste of time and energy reading through a ton of uninformed, misleading, and/or unorganized comments. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could avoid getting lost in the comments and get the most representative opinion of everyone who had commented? Wouldn’t it be even better if we could break up those comments into different social groups and gather analytics regarding the users in those social groups? This is exactly what we at CommonGround aim to do.

//Problem

Usually it is difficult to decipher and put into words the overall opinion of a given social group. More so, it is near impossible to read through all of the comments at the end of an article or on social media and extract all of the well-thought-out and informed comments from those that are counterproductive, irrelevant, or just unrepresentative of the whole. CommonGround aims to solve this problem.

//Solution

CommonGround is the idea-sharing platform that aims for better understanding between opposing social groups and their opinions as a whole. How does it work? Any given user is able to create a discussion about any topic and select different social groups that the user would like to better understand. Other users are then allowed one of three options to contribute to the discussion. They may add a comment into one of the set CommonGrounds, they may up-vote a comment that they may feel that they relate to, or they may down-vote a comment that they feel is not representative of that given social group as a whole. After multiple user interactions, the most representative comment is up-voted to the top position, which is the most representative comment of that given CommonGround.
